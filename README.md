Tic Tac Toe by Ghost

Description

This is a web-based React project for the classic game Tic Tac Toe, built for 2 players. The game features a clean playable interface where two users can take turns marking X and O on a 3×3 grid. It tracks whose turn it is, detects wins (three in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally), and identifies draws when the board is full without a winner.

Key Features

Simple, intuitive UI: 3×3 grid layout, minimalistic styling.

State management: React handles game state (turns, board status, win/draw detection).

Responsive design: Works in modern browsers, and adapts to different screen sizes.

Hosted live: Deployed via Netlify so you can instantly access and test it online.

Code-based: Ideal for learning or showcasing skills in React (components, hooks, state, logic).

Why It’s Useful

Great for beginners: Demonstrates how to build game logic in React (handling board state changes, conditional rendering, detecting game end-conditions).

Portfolio piece: Shows ability to develop, deploy and host a full interactive web app.

Customisable: Easy to extend (e.g., add restart button, score counter, AI opponent, animations) if you want to enhance it further.

Technical Stack

Framework/Libraries: React (functional components + hooks).

Hosting: Netlify (automatic build and deployment from GitHub).

Languages: JavaScript (or TypeScript, if you used it) + CSS for styling.
